# Next.js 15 API Route Fetch Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when fetching data from an API route within a Next.js 15 page component. The issue arises from not properly handling the asynchronous nature of API requests and the potential for errors during the fetch process.

## Bug Description

The `pages/about.js` component attempts to fetch data from the `/api/data` route.  However, it directly renders the `fetch` promise, which will result in an error because it's not resolved yet and also does not handle potential network errors or failed API requests.  This leads to the page crashing and displaying an error message.

## Solution

The provided solution (`pages/aboutSolution.js`) addresses this issue using `async/await` and a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors gracefully. This ensures a smoother user experience by displaying an appropriate message or fallback content in case of failure.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
5. Navigate to `/about` in your browser.

You'll notice the error on the original code, which is resolved in the `aboutSolution.js` file.
